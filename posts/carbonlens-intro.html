            <h1>Why I'm Building CarbonLens</h1>
            <div class="post-meta">December 22, 2025 | By Sharanya Vats</div>
            
            <p>
                I'm a high school sophomore who has spent several hours so far building CarbonLens - 
                a tool that calculates how much CO₂ your AI usage generates.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Last month, I learned that training GPT-3 generated 552 tons of CO₂. 
                That's equivalent to driving 1.2 million miles.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But here's what nobody talks about: What about USING AI every day?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Billions of people use ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney. Every query, every 
                image generation, every conversation consumes energy and generates emissions. 
                What's the cumulative impact of all those queries?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I couldn't find a simple answer. Most research focuses on training costs, 
                not inference costs. So I decided to build something myself.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>
                CarbonLens makes AI's environmental impact visible and understandable.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here's how it works:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                1. You tell it which AI tool you used (ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, etc.)<br>
                2. You tell it how many minutes you used it<br>
                3. It calculates your CO₂ emissions<br>
                4. It shows equivalents you can understand - phone charges, driving distance, trees needed to offset
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Version 1 is simple. It's not perfect. But it works.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                Building CarbonLens taught me several things:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, the data is surprisingly hard to find. While training emissions are 
                well-documented, inference emissions vary wildly based on model architecture, 
                hardware, and grid carbon intensity.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Second, the scale is staggering. If ChatGPT's 100 million users each spent 
                just 10 minutes per day using it, that's roughly 50 tons of CO₂ daily - or 
                18,000 tons per year. And that's just one AI tool.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Third, people care when they can see the impact. Abstract numbers like "0.5g per minute" 
                don't resonate. But "equivalent to charging 6 smartphones" does.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>
                This is just Version 1. I'm planning to add:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                • User accounts to track emissions over time<br>
                • More AI tools and more accurate data<br>
                • Chrome extension for automatic tracking<br>
                • Comparison tools to see how different models compare<br>
                • Integration with actual power grid data for real-time carbon intensity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My ultimate goal: Make every AI user aware of their environmental impact 
                and empower them to make more sustainable choices.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a sophomore planning to study computational environmental science. 
                I want to work at NASA as an environmental scientist for space exploration.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                CarbonLens connects to this mission: Whether analyzing AI's water consumption 
                on Earth or studying radiation in space, we need to understand the environmental 
                impacts of our technology.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is my first step in that direction.
            </p>
