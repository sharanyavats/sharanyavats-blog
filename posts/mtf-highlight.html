            <h1>Modeling the Future Challenge: Selected as Top 1% Project</h1>
            <div class="post-meta">December 15, 2025 | By Sharanya Vats</div>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> My project "AI Data Centers' Carbon Emissions and Water Depletion in Metro Atlanta" was selected as one of three project highlights from 381 semifinalist teams in the Modeling the Future Challenge.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                The Modeling the Future Challenge is a national actuarial science competition 
                where high school students apply mathematical and statistical modeling to 
                real-world problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This year, I chose to investigate an issue that connects my interests in 
                technology and environmental science: the hidden water crisis caused by AI 
                data centers.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone knows AI consumes massive amounts of electricity. But few discuss 
                the water consumption.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Data centers require enormous amounts of water for cooling. In Metro Atlanta, 
                where several major tech companies operate data centers, this creates 
                sustainability challenges - especially during drought conditions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My research question: How do we quantify the actuarial and environmental 
                risks of AI data center water consumption under different climate scenarios?
            </p>
            
            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>
                I combined several methodologies:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>1. Data Collection:</strong> Gathered public utility data, climate 
                projections, and data center energy usage patterns for the Atlanta region.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>2. Actuarial Modeling:</strong> Applied risk assessment frameworks 
                to quantify financial impacts under different scenarios.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>3. Climate Analysis:</strong> Incorporated drought predictions and 
                water supply constraints into the model.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>4. Policy Implications:</strong> Analyzed how different regulatory 
                approaches might affect outcomes.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Why It Was Highlighted</h2>
            <p>
                Out of 381 semifinalist teams, only three projects were selected as highlights 
                during the program's national meeting. I believe mine stood out because:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                • It addresses a timely, urgent problem that's underresearched<br>
                • It combines actuarial science with environmental analysis<br>
                • It has local relevance (Metro Atlanta) with global implications<br>
                • It demonstrates how mathematical modeling can inform policy decisions
            </p>
            
            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>
                The next phase involves:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                • Creating a detailed infographic (due February 2, 2026)<br>
                • Writing a comprehensive 25-page research report (due March 2, 2026)<br>
                • Presenting at regional finalist events (March 16-20, 2026)<br>
                • Competing for finalist status and scholarships
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm working with a professional actuarial mentor who's helping me refine 
                my methodology and strengthen my analysis.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
            <p>
                This project connects to my broader mission: using computational methods 
                to understand and solve environmental challenges.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether it's AI's carbon footprint, water consumption, or future challenges 
                in space sustainability, we need rigorous analytical frameworks to make 
                informed decisions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Modeling the Future Challenge is helping me develop these skills while 
                addressing a real problem that matters.
